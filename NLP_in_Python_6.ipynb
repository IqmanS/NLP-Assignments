Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\n\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\n\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\n\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\n\\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\n\\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\n\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\n\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\n\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\n\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that\\u2019s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I\\u2019m at the end of the tour right now. I\\u2019m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so\\u2026 any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So\\u2026 [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she\\u2019s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she\\u2019s very sweet, but she\\u2019s shit at telling stories, and I\\u2019m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019ll be a problem in the future, but it\\u2019s a problem now and I don\\u2019t see it getting better. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we\\u2019re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, \\u201cOh, I used to party with Madonna.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cYou fucking what, when?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI used to party with Madonna.\\u201d Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I\\u2019m not bragging. I didn\\u2019t get the model years. I didn\\u2019t get those years. I\\u2019ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um\\u2026 So, I said, \\u201cSo you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cNo, no, it would just be me and a few other people.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou need to elaborate on this story right now.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cOh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.\\u201d As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy\\u2019s even slightly in proportion\\u2026 a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why your cunt\\u2019s so fucked up.\\u201d That\\u2019s a big one. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.\\u201d So she said, \\u201cI used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna\\u2019s house.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cThis one time, the four of us were over at Madonna\\u2019s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another\\u2026\\u201d And then I went, \\u201cShut the fuck up!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know what \\u2018one thing led to another\\u2019 means! You all started fucking each other!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWe did. We started\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cJust shut up!\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWhat do you care for?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the mother of my child! I don\\u2019t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7\\u20192\\u2033 NBA player while you\\u2019re licking out Madonna\\u2019s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going\\u2026\\u201d [Moaning] And she goes, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re being silly. What do you care for? You\\u2019ve partied way more than I have in my life.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cThat is not true. I\\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn\\u2019t call it a party.\\u201d For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It\\u2019s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We\\u2019re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, \\u201cWell\\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they\\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys.\\u201d [Chuckles] I don\\u2019t\\u2026 You know, I\\u2019ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I\\u2019ve had good nights out, but I\\u2019ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it\\u2019s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it\\u2019s gotta involve celebrity, right? I\\u2019m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there\\u2019s the night club, but then there\\u2019s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It\\u2019s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just\\u2026 They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you\\u2019re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they\\u2019re going, \\u201cNo, dude. Use the table. Don\\u2019t use your\\u2026\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um\\u2026\\u201d And it\\u2019s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring \\u2019em in like, \\u201cHuh?\\u201d And you can do this. You can go\\u2026 \\u201cUh\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And they\\u2019ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you\\u2019ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there\\u2019s a lot of remorse \\u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.\\u201d When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.\\u201d And that\\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t think women will never\\u2026 Yeah, okay.\\nThis is the thing. In America, at the moment, they\\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don\\u2019t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, \\u201cAnd still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.\\u201d And of course, that\\u2019s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like\\u2026 a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don\\u2019t actually mean, but this is something I\\u2019m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2026 [Audience whooping] I\\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I\\u2019m not saying that women don\\u2019t work as hard. I\\u2019m sure they do. I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t do as good a job. What I\\u2019m saying is they don\\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s women in this room that are saying, \\u201cOh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.\\u201d And don\\u2019t think we don\\u2019t appreciate the uglies, \\u2019cause we do. Right? We do. But there\\u2019s little things in society that you can\\u2019t change. Men have extra expenses that you\\u2019ll never understand. There\\u2019s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine\\u2019s Day is just for women. They say it\\u2019s for romantics. They say it\\u2019s for couples or something like that. It\\u2019s just for women. There\\u2019s no man who gets excited by Valentine\\u2019s Day. There\\u2019s no man that when he sees the Valentine\\u2019s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, \\u201cOh, Valentine\\u2019s Day is coming!\\u201d Valentine\\u2019s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, \\u201cHow much money do I have to spend today so that you won\\u2019t act like a cunt?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t stop there. Mother\\u2019s Day! Mother\\u2019s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend\\u2019s first Mother\\u2019s Day. And she went, \\u201cOh, I wonder what I\\u2019ll get for Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cProbably fucking nothing. He\\u2019s got no money. He\\u2019s six months old. What do you think he\\u2019s gonna buy you?\\u201d Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother\\u2019s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine \\u2019cause I assumed that\\u2019s what Hank would have wanted her to have\\u2026 and I wrote a card. I\\u2019m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I\\u2019m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] \\u201cHappy Mother\\u2019s Day. Love, Hank.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cH-A-N\\u2026\\u201d And then I did the \\u201cK\\u201d back-to-front because he\\u2019s a fucking moron. See, now I know there\\u2019s people in the room, they\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cWell, fathers have Father\\u2019s Day.\\u201d Father\\u2019s Day is bullshit. It\\u2019s fucking shit, Father\\u2019s Day. Father\\u2019s Day came around and my girlfriend went, \\u201cWhat do you want for Father\\u2019s Day?\\u201d And I went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anything. Don\\u2019t even worry about it. I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on. You gotta have something.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHonestly, I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my fucking money. Just don\\u2019t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don\\u2019t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.\\u201d That\\u2019s why every single father has that one Father\\u2019s Day gift that they cherish, and it\\u2019s shit! It\\u2019s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\\u2019s too big, and it says, \\u201cI heart Dad.\\u201d And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go\\u2026 \\u201cThat cost me nothing, that mug.\\u201d [Audience whooping] See\\u2026 wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn\\u2019t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I\\u2019ve got it, right? April 18th\\u2026 Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It\\u2019s good, isn\\u2019t it? Everyone\\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It\\u2019s nice. A month before, you\\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going, \\u201cOh, the decorations are up!\\u201d [Men whooping] And it\\u2019s good \\u2019cause if your bird didn\\u2019t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine\\u2019s Day when they don\\u2019t get a gift. You could go like, \\u201cOh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they\\u2019re more connected than we are. They\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, I don\\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I\\u2019m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting \\u201cJim Jefferies\\u201d on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, \\u201cApril 18th.\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s good, right? You\\u2019re in a bar. You\\u2019re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go\\u2026 Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt.\\nThe weird thing is I\\u2019m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don\\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I\\u2019m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it\\u2019s a much more\\u2026 I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex\\u2026 Oh, you know\\u2026 I do it. I get involved, \\u2019cause I feel like I have to. You know, I\\u2026 But I\\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh\\u2026 When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl\\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh\\u2026 But the thing is, you can\\u2019t smell porn. You don\\u2019t smell porn. You just\\u2026 You just watch it. They never\\u2026 And it\\u2019s different, porn. It\\u2019s different. They clean the girl\\u2019s asshole. They pump water into it until it\\u2019s very hygienic. I\\u2019m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She\\u2019s like\\u2026 You\\u2019ve got it in her pussy, you\\u2019re fucking her, and then she\\u2019s like, \\u201cPut it in my ass.\\u201d She\\u2019s inviting. It\\u2019s like you\\u2019re doing her a favor in porn. And then she\\u2019s like\\u2026 She says things\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know, things like, \\u201cI\\u2019m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.\\u201d And\\u2026 And the experience I\\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I\\u2019ve\\u2026 My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it\\u2019s not what you want\\u2026 It\\u2019s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she\\u2019s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna act like I enjoy it.\\u201d She does that whole, \\u201cYeah. Oh, no, that\\u2019s good.\\u201d [Moaning] Ahh! \\u266a I\\u2019m having a good time \\u266a And then they\\u2019re always going, \\u201cAre you done? Are you close to done?\\u201d You never fuck a pussy and they go, \\u201cAre you almost done? Finish this.\\u201d Like that. If you\\u2019re fucking ass, they don\\u2019t want you\\u2026 They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don\\u2019t know how much they get paid. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s more than what the men get paid. It\\u2019s the opposite bit of society. Um\\u2026 But they do a thing called \\u201cATM.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for \\u201cass to mouth.\\u201d That\\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she\\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth, and she\\u2019ll say something like, \\u201cI love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.\\u201d And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\\u2026 [Applause] she\\u2019s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she\\u2019d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I\\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don\\u2019t know of any man, if they\\u2019re truthful, really is. Now, there\\u2019s women in the room who are thinking, \\u201cWell, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?\\u201d [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\\u2026 we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering]\\nSo\\u2026 I\\u2019m a father. Um\\u2026 I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I\\u2019m thinking about how he\\u2019s fucking killing me. He\\u2019s a good little boy. No, he\\u2019s a great little fella. I really like him. Um\\u2026 My girlfriend super loves him, though. It\\u2019s fucking creepy. And\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn\\u2019t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn\\u2019t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn\\u2019t fuck it. I\\u2026 I just don\\u2019t get along with women. You know how it is. I don\\u2019t want them in my house, and\\u2026 So\\u2026 Because you dream, see\\u2026 For example, okay? When Hank was born\\u2026 the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was\\u2026 \\u201cAw, that\\u2019s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I think\\u2026 \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what I think about my son. I hope when he\\u2019s of age, he just fucks everything. I don\\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, \\u201cOh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you\\u2019re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.\\u201d Right, you know\\u2026 And it\\u2019s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there\\u2019s a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there\\u2019s, like, three women in their 50s. They\\u2019re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there\\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it\\u2019s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, \\u201cUh, uh!\\u201d Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, \\u201cEveryone, my boyfriend\\u2019s here. Here\\u2019s my boyfriend. Give him here. He\\u2019s my boyfriend.\\u201d And then she kisses him, and she goes, \\u266a My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a It\\u2019s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl\\u2026 Let\\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\\u2019s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. \\u201cHey, everyone\\u2026 me girlfriend\\u2019s here. Give her here. Give her here. She\\u2019s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She\\u2019s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don\\u2019t worry about a thing.\\u201d [Applause] [Cheering] So\\u2026 Also\\u2026 it\\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It\\u2019s just little things. Even when they\\u2019re babies, it\\u2019s just easier. There\\u2019s a wiping technique when you\\u2019re wiping a baby\\u2019s ass. I don\\u2019t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It\\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. \\u2018Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don\\u2019t give a shit. Fucking\\u2026 My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I\\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he\\u2019ll be laughing like it\\u2019s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I\\u2019ve got shit on my dick, I\\u2019ll ring me mate Jason up and go, \\u201cHey, Jason\\u2026 It\\u2019s happened again. I got shit on my dick.\\u201d And he\\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we\\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\\u2019s thought, \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait to call Karen.\\u201d [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you\\u2026 When my girlfriend got pregnant\\u2026 When you meet\\u2026 When you haven\\u2019t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they\\u2019re always like, \\u201cIt is the most fulfilling thing I\\u2019ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.\\u201d And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It\\u2019s over. You\\u2019re not gonna sleep.\\u201d They\\u2019re constantly telling you you\\u2019re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I\\u2019ll tell you what, it\\u2019s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it\\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I\\u2019ve had girlfriends. That\\u2019s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, \\u201cFuck it! Let\\u2019s have a kid.\\u201d Fucking did it, right? These other people, man\\u2026 You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?\\u201d And you wanna say, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re really boring and we hate you.\\u201d But you go, \\u201cOh, okay, great. You\\u2019re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.\\u201d And\\u2026 And then what they do is they don\\u2019t have a kid right away because they\\u2019re still not ready. \\u201cWe have to see how our careers are going and shit.\\u201d And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog\\u2019s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog\\u2026 and it says, \\u201cFrom our family to yours.\\u201d And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is this shit?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.\\u201d And you go, \\u201cWell, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control\\u2026\\u201d And then, eventually, they decide they\\u2019re gonna have a kid \\u2019cause they\\u2019ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening? A new person.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck off. We don\\u2019t love you anymore. We\\u2019re going.\\u201d And they think they\\u2019ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven\\u2019t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard\\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you\\u2019re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I\\u2019m not saying \\u2019cause they look the same. I\\u2019m saying \\u2019cause they\\u2019re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything\\u2026 it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I\\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going\\u2026 \\u201cYolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.\\u201d [Jeffries chuckles]\\nI\\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh\\u2026 Gun control. Now\\u2026 No, wait. Before you\\u2026 Don\\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, \\u201cYeah! Do it, Jim!\\u201d No, let\\u2019s just\\u2026 [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I\\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I\\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the\\u2026 Oh, it doesn\\u2019t matter. I don\\u2019t like guns, right? I\\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn\\u2019t been beaten. And\\u2026 Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn\\u2019t been a single massacre since. I don\\u2019t know how or why this happened, uh\\u2026 Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it! No more guns!\\u201d And we all went, \\u201cYeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.\\u201d Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, \\u201cMaybe\\u2026 we\\u2019ll get rid of the big guns?\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my guns!\\u201d [Whooping] So, here\\u2019s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It\\u2019s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument\\u2026 \\u201cFuck off. I like guns.\\u201d It\\u2019s not the best argument, but it\\u2019s all you\\u2019ve got. And there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \\u201cI like something. Don\\u2019t take it away from me.\\u201d But don\\u2019t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] \\u201cI need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.\\u201d Really? Is that why they\\u2019re called \\u201cassault rifles\\u201d? Is it? I\\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \\u201cprotection rifles\\u201d you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you\\u2019re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019d never happen to me.\\u201d You don\\u2019t know that, because you know what?\\n\\u266a From time to time We all get sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a One day you\\u2019re happy Then you\\u2019re sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a And then, uh-oh \\u266a\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] \\u201cWell, imagine if you had a gun.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAll right. I was naked at the time. I wasn\\u2019t wearing my holster. I wasn\\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.\\u201d What world do you live in where you\\u2019re constantly fucking ready? You have guns \\u2019cause you like guns! That\\u2019s why you go to gun conventions! That\\u2019s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, \\u201cFucking yeah!\\u201d Like you\\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\\u2019s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it\\u2019s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, \\u201cThat\\u2019d never happen in my house \\u2019cause I\\u2019m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.\\u201d Then they\\u2019re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWait there, fuck-face! Oh! You\\u2019ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I\\u2019m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother\\u2019s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother\\u2019s birthday? Maybe if you didn\\u2019t leave the window open [In whining voice] \\u2018because it\\u2019s too hot in here,\\u2019 we wouldn\\u2019t be getting fucking murdered, right?\\u201d I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, \\u201cNone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.\\u201d I\\u2026 I think they\\u2019re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\\u2026 Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re gonna make her cry.\\u201d And then she\\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you\\u2019d go, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.\\u201d Then she\\u2019d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she\\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel, just, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t they like me?\\u201d Let\\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, \\u201cOh, well, answer to that, we\\u2019ll just add more guns.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.\\u201d Yeah, that\\u2019ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and\\u2026 [Mimicking machine gun] And you\\u2019ve got Kevin. Now, I\\u2019m sure Kevin\\u2019s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I\\u2019m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don\\u2019t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don\\u2019t agree with me. Don\\u2019t think I don\\u2019t. Out of the 50% that don\\u2019t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\\u2019s not to be taken seriously, and they\\u2019re laughing along \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They\\u2019re looking around, going, \\u201cWonder how they got that chandelier up there?\\u201d And then\\u2026 there\\u2019s the last 10%. And they\\u2019re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home\\u2026 10% of you are fucking seething. Just\\u2026 And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I\\u2019m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I\\u2019m foreign\\u2026 and that\\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can\\u2019t fucking turn it off, and it\\u2019s just going around in a circle, and you\\u2019re just going, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like it, go home! If you don\\u2019t like it, go home!\\u201d And my answer to that is, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I\\u2019ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And\\u2026 unless you\\u2019re an American Indian, you\\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It\\u2019s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don\\u2019t know what it says. I\\u2019ve never seen it. If there\\u2019s a problem, we\\u2019ll check it, but everything\\u2019s going fine. And don\\u2019t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had\\u2026 Fucking, I get it, right? I\\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I\\u2019m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] \\u201cYou cannot change the Second Amendment!\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, you can. It\\u2019s called an \\u2018amendment.'\\u201d If you can\\u2019t change something that\\u2019s called an \\u201camendment\\u201d, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don\\u2019t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don\\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone. You\\u2019ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, \\u201cHey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let\\u2019s get that one out. Let\\u2019s get that one out.\\u201d You used to have this other thing in America called, uh\\u2026 slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. No more slaves!\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my slaves!\\u201d And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. \\u201cWhy should I have my slaves taken off me? I\\u2019m a responsible slave owner. I\\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I\\u2026 I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me? I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\\u201d Look, I agree with you. If you\\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\\u2019t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that\\u2019s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can\\u2019t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! \\u201cOh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.\\u201d Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can\\u2019t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. \\u201cThanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!\\u201d See, that\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me, I\\u2019m responsible, just because that guy\\u2019s crazy?\\u201d Who\\u2019s to say you\\u2019re not crazy? That\\u2019s the thing about crazy people. They don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re crazy. That\\u2019s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, \\u201cI think, therefore I am.\\u201d You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that\\u2019s it. Right now, I think I\\u2019m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That\\u2019s what I think I\\u2019m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I\\u2019m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cI hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.\\u201d [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, \\u201cWell, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.\\u201d Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It\\u2019ll be delivered to your house. That\\u2019s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don\\u2019t need to be a criminal. You\\u2019ve got $34,000. You\\u2019re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn\\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them \\u2019cause they go\\u2026 The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let\\u2019s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger\\u2019s as fuck. Right? I don\\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can\\u2019t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cGuns! Who wants to sell me a gun?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019m gonna wrap this up. We won\\u2019t talk about it anymore. Now\\u2026 See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with\\u2026 That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that\\u2019s why it was written. \\u2013 [Audience cheering] \\u2013 Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You\\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I\\u2019m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets\\u2026 Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what\\u2019s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck you, buddy! Ah, you\\u2019re not a bad guy. You\\u2019re all right.\\u201d\\nNow\\u2026 after the show, we\\u2019re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I\\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that\\u2019s a no\\u2026 \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t behave myself in there, so I\\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore. \\u2018Cause strip clubs aren\\u2019t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like\\u2026 Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it\\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That\\u2019s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\\u2026 women wanna see a guy, \\u201cHey, ladies. He\\u2019s a fireman.\\u201d And he comes out with his hose and like that\\u2026 And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they\\u2019ve still got the fireman\\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\\u2019s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man\\u2019s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job\\u2019s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go\\u2026 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take care of your kids.\\u201d It\\u2019s\\u2026 And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it\\u2019s dry humping. There\\u2019s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go\\u2026 That\\u2019s what a private \\u201cdance\\u201d is, right? I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can\\u2019t imagine that there would be. I don\\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\\u2026 She goes, \\u201cHow was it?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell\\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.\\u201d\\nSo Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would\\u2019ve thought it would\\u2019ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you\\u2019re watching the special. It was\\u2026 I\\u2019m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Now\\u2026 The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\\u2026 In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He\\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he\\u2019s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now\\u2026 the great thing about DJ is\\u2026 he already looks disabled. He has that \\u201clatter stages of AIDS\\u201d thing going on. It\\u2019s great for casting. Anyway, but\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors\\u2019 Union of America said, \\u201cYou cannot do that.\\u201d Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, \\u201cAll right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?\\u201d And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, \\u201cCan you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?\\u201d So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I\\u2019ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don\\u2019t know why. Maybe they\\u2019re just lazy. They don\\u2019t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good \\u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and\\u2026 they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I\\u2019d ever seen in my life. He was like\\u2026 Think of the most disabled person you\\u2019ve seen, then double it. \\u2026really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of\\u2026 [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway\\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\\u2026 and I\\u2019m sitting there, and we\\u2019re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn\\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, \\u201cThank you so much for coming in.\\u201d And then we did the dialog together, and I didn\\u2019t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our guy. That\\u2019s who we gotta pick.\\u201d And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he\\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\\u2019s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn\\u2019t really suit me because\\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought\\u2026 \\u201cIf he\\u2019s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.\\u201d So he comes in\\u2026 He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, \\u201cWhoa! What\\u2019s going on there, kicky?\\u201d And he goes\\u2026 \\u201cOh, you got me! I\\u2019m not disabled.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re fucking what now?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cJust shut up. So let me\\u2026 This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.\\u201d And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I\\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I\\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\\u2019ve got parts, and I\\u2019m holding this disabled guy\\u2019s headshot, and I just think, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna call this guy up. I\\u2019m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?\\u201d And I\\u2019m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like\\u2026 And I thought, \\u201cThis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.\\u201d The shutter on his camera has gotta be like\\u2026 [Mimicking camera shutter] Like\\u2026 [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy\\u2019s biography\\u2026 and then it dawned on me. \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!\\u201d Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I\\u2019m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, \\u201cTa-da!\\u201d And we would have gone, \\u201cThat was very good.\\u201d But I\\u2019ll tell you what you don\\u2019t do. Don\\u2019t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, \\u201cYou did very good.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThank you, Jim.\\u201d [Laughing]\\n[Chuckles] I was, uh\\u2026 I go to a therapist\\u2026 \\u2019cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.\\u201d Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, \\u201cRed,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cBlue.\\u201d And then she went, \\u201cCooking,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cFood,\\u201d and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went\\u2026 For the last question, she went, \\u201cAnd what\\u2019s your favorite thing in the world?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d Now\\u2026 Now, I could\\u2019ve said things like\\u2026 \\u201cIce cream\\u201d is a good answer. \\u201cHank\\u201d would\\u2019ve been an excellent answer. But I said, \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d And I\\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. \\u2013 I\\u2026 \\u2013 [Cheering] I\\u2019m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It\\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl\\u2019s on her knees and you\\u2026 It\\u2019s so\\u2026 And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, \\u201cWhen a caveman loves a cavewoman, he\\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\\u2019t come near.\\u201d There was never that\\u2026 never that moment. But, by golly, if it\\u2019s not fun. I find it\\u2026 To\\u2026 Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, \\u201cBravo!\\u201d Don\\u2019t\\u2026 don\\u2019t think what you do\\u2026 has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, \\u201cAnd here\\u2019s the women who take a load on their face.\\u201d And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, \\u201cGod bless you, ladies.\\u201d [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the\\u2026 Like that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know why, but I enjoy\\u2026 I know it\\u2019s a lie. I know you\\u2019re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it\\u2019s such a, \\u201cOh, jeez, I\\u2019m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there\\u2019s a good chance I\\u2019ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.\\u201d But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou fucking slut\\u2026 Oh, I love you. Ah\\u2026 Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um\\u2026 Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh\\u2026 All right, I\\u2019m going to get a towel. I\\u2019ll get a towel. I\\u2019ll get you a towel. All right. You\\u2019re a wonderful mother to our child.\\u201d [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See\\u2026 this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I\\u2019m the guy who\\u2019s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I\\u2019m there wiping come off his mother\\u2019s face.\\nI think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I\\u2019m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, \\u201cArgh!\\u201d Like that. And I went\\u2026 [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, \\u201cHello, Hankie.\\u201d And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him\\u2026 and a little suit\\u2026 and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, \\u201cI love my daddy. Love, Hank.\\u201d But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the \\u201cK,\\u201d and\\u2026 then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, \\u201cG\\u2019day, Hankie!\\u201d And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don\\u2019t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I\\u2019ve been telling everyone. And I can\\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life, he\\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He\\u2019s been training for this his entire life.\\nI think I\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026 I think I\\u2019ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, \\u201cOh, I think like an American person now.\\u201d And I\\u2019m happy to do it. I just\\u2026 I\\u2019ll tell you what happened. I was flying around\\u2026 I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I\\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in America that\\u2026 Okay, what happens is, when you go\\u2026 I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there\\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don\\u2019t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady\\u2019s going, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I\\u2019m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. \\u2018Cause I get through airports quick, man. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFucking there you go.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPut your ID away. I don\\u2019t need to see that.\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cI think you do.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t\\u2026 Why would I need to see your ID?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI might be a terrorist.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWould showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?\\u201d \\u201cNo, I\\u2019d probably still blow the plane up.\\u201d So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I\\u2019m so good at the airports. I\\u2019m already taking my shoes off as I\\u2019m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I\\u2019m American, and they\\u2019re losing their fucking shit. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, for fuck\\u2019s sake! One of these cunts, eh?\\u201d And the TSA guy goes, \\u201cHey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 [Shouting] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know! Maybe they\\u2019re bombs?\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cBut they\\u2019re not, are they?\\u201d I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone\\u2019s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, \\u201cJeez, mate. That\\u2019s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?\\u201d \\u201cIt might also be a bomb.\\u201d And then the guy said the most Australian thing I\\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\\u2019s mouth ever. He went\\u2026 \\u201cOh, come on, mate. You wouldn\\u2019t have two bombs.\\u201d [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I\\u2019m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense.\\nAll right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven\\u2019t been following the case, you\\u2019re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You\\u2019re fucking missing out, mate. If you don\\u2019t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He\\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine\\u2019s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth\\u2026 and that\\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\\u2026 \\u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can\\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there\\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone\\u2026 He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine\\u2019s Day, right? Now, I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running\\u2019s their second sport. You wouldn\\u2019t have thought that. Anyway\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can\\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here\\u2019s the difference. Picture my accent, but I\\u2019m punching a black person. What I\\u2019m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So\\u2026 she\\u2019s coming out of the shower. She\\u2019s been drying her hair. She\\u2019s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He\\u2019s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he\\u2019s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\\u2019ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?\\u201d \\u201cWho am I? I\\u2019m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That\\u2019s who the fuck I am.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.\\u201d \\u2013 [Audience exclaiming] \\u2013 I know. [Audience laughing] \\u201cOh! Fuck you!\\u201d \\u201cNo! Fuck you! I\\u2019m leaving you!\\u201d And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like\\u2026 \\u201cYou fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day\\u2026 that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don\\u2019t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!\\u201d That\\u2019s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.\\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn\\u2019t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar\\u2019s one of the few men on Earth that couldn\\u2019t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so\\u2026 Boing! Ah! So\\u2026 I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now\\u2026 in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put \\u201ca man\\u201d in that sentence, but whatever. I\\u2019ve never raped a man, but\\u2026 if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian\\u2026 \\u2019cause in prison, it\\u2019s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you\\u2019re tough and all that. Like, \\u201cYou want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?\\u201d There\\u2019d be a wonderful moment\\u2026 when you\\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He\\u2019s the hero.\\nAll right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, \\u2013 I thank you very much for coming. \\u2013 [Audience groaning] No, I said, \\u201csoon,\\u201d not \\u201cover.\\u201d It\\u2019s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always\\u2026 I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I\\u2019m going to go, \\u201cFucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.\\u201d [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll be invited this time. They\\u2019ll be like, [In South African accent] \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like him. He\\u2019s no good.\\u201d Anyway, so, I\\u2019m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You\\u2019ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um\\u2026 But it was all right \\u2019cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn\\u2019t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice \\u2019cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I\\u2019ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit\\u2026 \\u2019cause it\\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\\u2019t want me there and they\\u2019re annoyed by my presence. So\\u2026 I\\u2019m wearing a white T-shirt that\\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I\\u2019m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, \\u201cHello,\\u201d and the lady goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cOh, Mr. Jefferies, I\\u2019m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou what now?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cBusiness class is full. You have been downgraded.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir. There\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d And then I just went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d Now, you know when you\\u2019re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, \\u2019cause as soon as you swear, they don\\u2019t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they\\u2019re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPlease do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cAre you, a white South African, telling me you\\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\\u201d Anyway\\u2026 tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat is wrong here? What is wrong?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can\\u2019t do anything.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d So I walk off with my ticket. I\\u2019m walking through the airport like, \\u201cFucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.\\u201d Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says \\u2018economy\\u2019 on it.\\u201d And I said\\u2026 [Inhales sharply] \\u201cI bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded\\u2026\\u201d And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, \\u201cNext.\\u201d [Audience exclaiming] \\u201cListen here, you fucking cunt.\\u201d [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say \\u201ccunt\\u201d in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you fucking come near me, cunt!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI want to speak to Simon Fulcher,\\u201d like I\\u2019m\\u2026 And they go, \\u201cAll right.\\u201d They ring the manager up, and then they go\\u2026 He goes, \\u201cIs it the pale Australian man?\\u201d And the guy went, \\u201cYes.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had problems with him. Let him through.\\u201d Right? So I go through. I\\u2019m sitting there, I\\u2019m eating my peanuts. And I\\u2019m just angry now, going, \\u201cFucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all\\u2026 And whenever I see Americans abroad\\u2026 I\\u2019ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you\\u2019re just pointing out shit you see. You\\u2019re just walking around going, [In American accent] \\u201cOh, this is great! Look at that. That\\u2019s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what\\u2019s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.\\u201d Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] \\u201cDid anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.\\u201d And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, \\u201cYou can fuck off and all! You don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve been through! I\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, \\u201cFucking downgraded!\\u201d And the woman in the group was doing this, \\u201cDon\\u2019t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?\\u201d And all the men in the group were like, \\u201cHey, why don\\u2019t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.\\u201d \\u266a It doesn\\u2019t matter These people seem very angry, so \\u266a And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] \\u201cHey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.\\u201d And then I thought, at least this guy\\u2019s being nice, and I said, \\u201cLook, mate, don\\u2019t worry about it. It\\u2019s not like it\\u2019s your fault.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy are you in such a big group anyway?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re in Neil Diamond\\u2019s band. That\\u2019s Neil Diamond\\u2019s backup singer you just called a cunt there.\\u201d And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero\\u2026 and I reacted like he was one. I went, \\u201cNeil Diamond!\\u201d And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] \\u201cHey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, \\u201cNeil! Me and all these people, we\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And Neil went, \\u201cOh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that\\u2019s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.\\u201d \\u201cYou can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!\\u201d And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don\\u2019t know if you have the Internet, but I\\u2019m not much of a fighter. I\\u2019m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. \\u201cHey, what have you got there? Hiya!\\u201d Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded\\u2026 but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let\\u2019s have a drink.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\n\\u266a A whole new world \\u266a\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.\\nI\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d\\nI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

It premiered on HBO on April 13, 2013. Filmed in Phoenix, Arizona at the Celebrity Theatre\\t\\t IntroFade the music out. Let\\u2019s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201dI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201dYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201dMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201dI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201dI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201dThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201dI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201dI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201dEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201dIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\u201cFirst Date\\u201dI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\u201cTits\\u201dGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\u201cDivorce\\u201dI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201dMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201dDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201dIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201dA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201dYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.Thanks a lot, folks. You guys were great. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.More:Louis C.K., Stand-up transcripts SHARE THIS ARTICLE           Leave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that\\u2019s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I\\u2019m at the end of the tour right now. I\\u2019m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so\\u2026 any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So\\u2026 [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she\\u2019s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she\\u2019s very sweet, but she\\u2019s shit at telling stories, and I\\u2019m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019ll be a problem in the future, but it\\u2019s a problem now and I don\\u2019t see it getting better. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we\\u2019re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, \\u201cOh, I used to party with Madonna.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cYou fucking what, when?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI used to party with Madonna.\\u201d Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I\\u2019m not bragging. I didn\\u2019t get the model years. I didn\\u2019t get those years. I\\u2019ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um\\u2026 So, I said, \\u201cSo you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cNo, no, it would just be me and a few other people.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou need to elaborate on this story right now.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cOh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.\\u201d As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy\\u2019s even slightly in proportion\\u2026 a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why your cunt\\u2019s so fucked up.\\u201d That\\u2019s a big one. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.\\u201d So she said, \\u201cI used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna\\u2019s house.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cThis one time, the four of us were over at Madonna\\u2019s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another\\u2026\\u201d And then I went, \\u201cShut the fuck up!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know what \\u2018one thing led to another\\u2019 means! You all started fucking each other!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWe did. We started\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cJust shut up!\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWhat do you care for?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the mother of my child! I don\\u2019t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7\\u20192\\u2033 NBA player while you\\u2019re licking out Madonna\\u2019s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going\\u2026\\u201d [Moaning] And she goes, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re being silly. What do you care for? You\\u2019ve partied way more than I have in my life.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cThat is not true. I\\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn\\u2019t call it a party.\\u201d For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It\\u2019s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We\\u2019re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, \\u201cWell\\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they\\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys.\\u201d [Chuckles] I don\\u2019t\\u2026 You know, I\\u2019ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I\\u2019ve had good nights out, but I\\u2019ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it\\u2019s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it\\u2019s gotta involve celebrity, right? I\\u2019m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there\\u2019s the night club, but then there\\u2019s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It\\u2019s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just\\u2026 They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you\\u2019re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they\\u2019re going, \\u201cNo, dude. Use the table. Don\\u2019t use your\\u2026\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um\\u2026\\u201d And it\\u2019s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring \\u2019em in like, \\u201cHuh?\\u201d And you can do this. You can go\\u2026 \\u201cUh\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And they\\u2019ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you\\u2019ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there\\u2019s a lot of remorse \\u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.\\u201d When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.\\u201d And that\\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t think women will never\\u2026 Yeah, okay.This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they\\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don\\u2019t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, \\u201cAnd still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.\\u201d And of course, that\\u2019s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like\\u2026 a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don\\u2019t actually mean, but this is something I\\u2019m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2026 [Audience whooping] I\\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I\\u2019m not saying that women don\\u2019t work as hard. I\\u2019m sure they do. I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t do as good a job. What I\\u2019m saying is they don\\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s women in this room that are saying, \\u201cOh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.\\u201d And don\\u2019t think we don\\u2019t appreciate the uglies, \\u2019cause we do. Right? We do. But there\\u2019s little things in society that you can\\u2019t change. Men have extra expenses that you\\u2019ll never understand. There\\u2019s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine\\u2019s Day is just for women. They say it\\u2019s for romantics. They say it\\u2019s for couples or something like that. It\\u2019s just for women. There\\u2019s no man who gets excited by Valentine\\u2019s Day. There\\u2019s no man that when he sees the Valentine\\u2019s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, \\u201cOh, Valentine\\u2019s Day is coming!\\u201d Valentine\\u2019s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, \\u201cHow much money do I have to spend today so that you won\\u2019t act like a cunt?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t stop there. Mother\\u2019s Day! Mother\\u2019s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend\\u2019s first Mother\\u2019s Day. And she went, \\u201cOh, I wonder what I\\u2019ll get for Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cProbably fucking nothing. He\\u2019s got no money. He\\u2019s six months old. What do you think he\\u2019s gonna buy you?\\u201d Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother\\u2019s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine \\u2019cause I assumed that\\u2019s what Hank would have wanted her to have\\u2026 and I wrote a card. I\\u2019m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I\\u2019m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] \\u201cHappy Mother\\u2019s Day. Love, Hank.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cH-A-N\\u2026\\u201d And then I did the \\u201cK\\u201d back-to-front because he\\u2019s a fucking moron. See, now I know there\\u2019s people in the room, they\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cWell, fathers have Father\\u2019s Day.\\u201d Father\\u2019s Day is bullshit. It\\u2019s fucking shit, Father\\u2019s Day. Father\\u2019s Day came around and my girlfriend went, \\u201cWhat do you want for Father\\u2019s Day?\\u201d And I went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anything. Don\\u2019t even worry about it. I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on. You gotta have something.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHonestly, I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my fucking money. Just don\\u2019t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don\\u2019t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.\\u201d That\\u2019s why every single father has that one Father\\u2019s Day gift that they cherish, and it\\u2019s shit! It\\u2019s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\\u2019s too big, and it says, \\u201cI heart Dad.\\u201d And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go\\u2026 \\u201cThat cost me nothing, that mug.\\u201d [Audience whooping] See\\u2026 wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn\\u2019t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I\\u2019ve got it, right? April 18th\\u2026 Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It\\u2019s good, isn\\u2019t it? Everyone\\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It\\u2019s nice. A month before, you\\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going, \\u201cOh, the decorations are up!\\u201d [Men whooping] And it\\u2019s good \\u2019cause if your bird didn\\u2019t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine\\u2019s Day when they don\\u2019t get a gift. You could go like, \\u201cOh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they\\u2019re more connected than we are. They\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, I don\\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I\\u2019m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting \\u201cJim Jefferies\\u201d on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, \\u201cApril 18th.\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s good, right? You\\u2019re in a bar. You\\u2019re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go\\u2026 Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt.The weird thing is I\\u2019m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don\\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I\\u2019m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it\\u2019s a much more\\u2026 I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex\\u2026 Oh, you know\\u2026 I do it. I get involved, \\u2019cause I feel like I have to. You know, I\\u2026 But I\\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh\\u2026 When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl\\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh\\u2026 But the thing is, you can\\u2019t smell porn. You don\\u2019t smell porn. You just\\u2026 You just watch it. They never\\u2026 And it\\u2019s different, porn. It\\u2019s different. They clean the girl\\u2019s asshole. They pump water into it until it\\u2019s very hygienic. I\\u2019m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She\\u2019s like\\u2026 You\\u2019ve got it in her pussy, you\\u2019re fucking her, and then she\\u2019s like, \\u201cPut it in my ass.\\u201d She\\u2019s inviting. It\\u2019s like you\\u2019re doing her a favor in porn. And then she\\u2019s like\\u2026 She says things\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know, things like, \\u201cI\\u2019m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.\\u201d And\\u2026 And the experience I\\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I\\u2019ve\\u2026 My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it\\u2019s not what you want\\u2026 It\\u2019s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she\\u2019s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna act like I enjoy it.\\u201d She does that whole, \\u201cYeah. Oh, no, that\\u2019s good.\\u201d [Moaning] Ahh! \\u266a I\\u2019m having a good time \\u266a And then they\\u2019re always going, \\u201cAre you done? Are you close to done?\\u201d You never fuck a pussy and they go, \\u201cAre you almost done? Finish this.\\u201d Like that. If you\\u2019re fucking ass, they don\\u2019t want you\\u2026 They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don\\u2019t know how much they get paid. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s more than what the men get paid. It\\u2019s the opposite bit of society. Um\\u2026 But they do a thing called \\u201cATM.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for \\u201cass to mouth.\\u201d That\\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she\\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth, and she\\u2019ll say something like, \\u201cI love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.\\u201d And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\\u2026 [Applause] she\\u2019s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she\\u2019d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I\\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don\\u2019t know of any man, if they\\u2019re truthful, really is. Now, there\\u2019s women in the room who are thinking, \\u201cWell, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?\\u201d [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\\u2026 we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering]So\\u2026 I\\u2019m a father. Um\\u2026 I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I\\u2019m thinking about how he\\u2019s fucking killing me. He\\u2019s a good little boy. No, he\\u2019s a great little fella. I really like him. Um\\u2026 My girlfriend super loves him, though. It\\u2019s fucking creepy. And\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn\\u2019t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn\\u2019t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn\\u2019t fuck it. I\\u2026 I just don\\u2019t get along with women. You know how it is. I don\\u2019t want them in my house, and\\u2026 So\\u2026 Because you dream, see\\u2026 For example, okay? When Hank was born\\u2026 the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was\\u2026 \\u201cAw, that\\u2019s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I think\\u2026 \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what I think about my son. I hope when he\\u2019s of age, he just fucks everything. I don\\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, \\u201cOh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you\\u2019re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.\\u201d Right, you know\\u2026 And it\\u2019s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there\\u2019s a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there\\u2019s, like, three women in their 50s. They\\u2019re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there\\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it\\u2019s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, \\u201cUh, uh!\\u201d Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, \\u201cEveryone, my boyfriend\\u2019s here. Here\\u2019s my boyfriend. Give him here. He\\u2019s my boyfriend.\\u201d And then she kisses him, and she goes, \\u266a My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a It\\u2019s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl\\u2026 Let\\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\\u2019s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. \\u201cHey, everyone\\u2026 me girlfriend\\u2019s here. Give her here. Give her here. She\\u2019s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She\\u2019s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don\\u2019t worry about a thing.\\u201d [Applause] [Cheering] So\\u2026 Also\\u2026 it\\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It\\u2019s just little things. Even when they\\u2019re babies, it\\u2019s just easier. There\\u2019s a wiping technique when you\\u2019re wiping a baby\\u2019s ass. I don\\u2019t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It\\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. \\u2018Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don\\u2019t give a shit. Fucking\\u2026 My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I\\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he\\u2019ll be laughing like it\\u2019s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I\\u2019ve got shit on my dick, I\\u2019ll ring me mate Jason up and go, \\u201cHey, Jason\\u2026 It\\u2019s happened again. I got shit on my dick.\\u201d And he\\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we\\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\\u2019s thought, \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait to call Karen.\\u201d [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you\\u2026 When my girlfriend got pregnant\\u2026 When you meet\\u2026 When you haven\\u2019t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they\\u2019re always like, \\u201cIt is the most fulfilling thing I\\u2019ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.\\u201d And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It\\u2019s over. You\\u2019re not gonna sleep.\\u201d They\\u2019re constantly telling you you\\u2019re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I\\u2019ll tell you what, it\\u2019s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it\\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I\\u2019ve had girlfriends. That\\u2019s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, \\u201cFuck it! Let\\u2019s have a kid.\\u201d Fucking did it, right? These other people, man\\u2026 You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?\\u201d And you wanna say, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re really boring and we hate you.\\u201d But you go, \\u201cOh, okay, great. You\\u2019re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.\\u201d And\\u2026 And then what they do is they don\\u2019t have a kid right away because they\\u2019re still not ready. \\u201cWe have to see how our careers are going and shit.\\u201d And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog\\u2019s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog\\u2026 and it says, \\u201cFrom our family to yours.\\u201d And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is this shit?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.\\u201d And you go, \\u201cWell, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control\\u2026\\u201d And then, eventually, they decide they\\u2019re gonna have a kid \\u2019cause they\\u2019ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening? A new person.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck off. We don\\u2019t love you anymore. We\\u2019re going.\\u201d And they think they\\u2019ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven\\u2019t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard\\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you\\u2019re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I\\u2019m not saying \\u2019cause they look the same. I\\u2019m saying \\u2019cause they\\u2019re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything\\u2026 it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I\\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going\\u2026 \\u201cYolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.\\u201d [Jeffries chuckles]I\\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh\\u2026 Gun control. Now\\u2026 No, wait. Before you\\u2026 Don\\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, \\u201cYeah! Do it, Jim!\\u201d No, let\\u2019s just\\u2026 [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I\\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I\\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the\\u2026 Oh, it doesn\\u2019t matter. I don\\u2019t like guns, right? I\\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn\\u2019t been beaten. And\\u2026 Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn\\u2019t been a single massacre since. I don\\u2019t know how or why this happened, uh\\u2026 Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it! No more guns!\\u201d And we all went, \\u201cYeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.\\u201d Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, \\u201cMaybe\\u2026 we\\u2019ll get rid of the big guns?\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my guns!\\u201d [Whooping] So, here\\u2019s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It\\u2019s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument\\u2026 \\u201cFuck off. I like guns.\\u201d It\\u2019s not the best argument, but it\\u2019s all you\\u2019ve got. And there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \\u201cI like something. Don\\u2019t take it away from me.\\u201d But don\\u2019t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] \\u201cI need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.\\u201d Really? Is that why they\\u2019re called \\u201cassault rifles\\u201d? Is it? I\\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \\u201cprotection rifles\\u201d you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you\\u2019re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019d never happen to me.\\u201d You don\\u2019t know that, because you know what?\\u266a From time to time We all get sad \\u266a \\u266a One day you\\u2019re happy Then you\\u2019re sad \\u266a \\u266a And then, uh-oh \\u266aProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] \\u201cWell, imagine if you had a gun.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAll right. I was naked at the time. I wasn\\u2019t wearing my holster. I wasn\\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.\\u201d What world do you live in where you\\u2019re constantly fucking ready? You have guns \\u2019cause you like guns! That\\u2019s why you go to gun conventions! That\\u2019s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, \\u201cFucking yeah!\\u201d Like you\\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\\u2019s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it\\u2019s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, \\u201cThat\\u2019d never happen in my house \\u2019cause I\\u2019m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.\\u201d Then they\\u2019re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWait there, fuck-face! Oh! You\\u2019ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I\\u2019m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother\\u2019s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother\\u2019s birthday? Maybe if you didn\\u2019t leave the window open [In whining voice] \\u2018because it\\u2019s too hot in here,\\u2019 we wouldn\\u2019t be getting fucking murdered, right?\\u201d I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, \\u201cNone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.\\u201d I\\u2026 I think they\\u2019re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\\u2026 Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re gonna make her cry.\\u201d And then she\\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you\\u2019d go, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.\\u201d Then she\\u2019d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she\\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel, just, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t they like me?\\u201d Let\\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, \\u201cOh, well, answer to that, we\\u2019ll just add more guns.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.\\u201d Yeah, that\\u2019ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and\\u2026 [Mimicking machine gun] And you\\u2019ve got Kevin. Now, I\\u2019m sure Kevin\\u2019s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I\\u2019m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don\\u2019t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don\\u2019t agree with me. Don\\u2019t think I don\\u2019t. Out of the 50% that don\\u2019t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\\u2019s not to be taken seriously, and they\\u2019re laughing along \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They\\u2019re looking around, going, \\u201cWonder how they got that chandelier up there?\\u201d And then\\u2026 there\\u2019s the last 10%. And they\\u2019re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home\\u2026 10% of you are fucking seething. Just\\u2026 And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I\\u2019m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I\\u2019m foreign\\u2026 and that\\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can\\u2019t fucking turn it off, and it\\u2019s just going around in a circle, and you\\u2019re just going, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like it, go home! If you don\\u2019t like it, go home!\\u201d And my answer to that is, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I\\u2019ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And\\u2026 unless you\\u2019re an American Indian, you\\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It\\u2019s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don\\u2019t know what it says. I\\u2019ve never seen it. If there\\u2019s a problem, we\\u2019ll check it, but everything\\u2019s going fine. And don\\u2019t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had\\u2026 Fucking, I get it, right? I\\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I\\u2019m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] \\u201cYou cannot change the Second Amendment!\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, you can. It\\u2019s called an \\u2018amendment.'\\u201d If you can\\u2019t change something that\\u2019s called an \\u201camendment\\u201d, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don\\u2019t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don\\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone. You\\u2019ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, \\u201cHey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let\\u2019s get that one out. Let\\u2019s get that one out.\\u201d You used to have this other thing in America called, uh\\u2026 slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. No more slaves!\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my slaves!\\u201d And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. \\u201cWhy should I have my slaves taken off me? I\\u2019m a responsible slave owner. I\\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I\\u2026 I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me? I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\\u201d Look, I agree with you. If you\\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\\u2019t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that\\u2019s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can\\u2019t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! \\u201cOh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.\\u201d Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can\\u2019t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. \\u201cThanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!\\u201d See, that\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me, I\\u2019m responsible, just because that guy\\u2019s crazy?\\u201d Who\\u2019s to say you\\u2019re not crazy? That\\u2019s the thing about crazy people. They don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re crazy. That\\u2019s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, \\u201cI think, therefore I am.\\u201d You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that\\u2019s it. Right now, I think I\\u2019m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That\\u2019s what I think I\\u2019m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I\\u2019m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cI hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.\\u201d [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, \\u201cWell, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.\\u201d Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It\\u2019ll be delivered to your house. That\\u2019s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don\\u2019t need to be a criminal. You\\u2019ve got $34,000. You\\u2019re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn\\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them \\u2019cause they go\\u2026 The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let\\u2019s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger\\u2019s as fuck. Right? I don\\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can\\u2019t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cGuns! Who wants to sell me a gun?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019m gonna wrap this up. We won\\u2019t talk about it anymore. Now\\u2026 See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with\\u2026 That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that\\u2019s why it was written. \\u2013 [Audience cheering] \\u2013 Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You\\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I\\u2019m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets\\u2026 Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what\\u2019s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck you, buddy! Ah, you\\u2019re not a bad guy. You\\u2019re all right.\\u201dNow\\u2026 after the show, we\\u2019re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I\\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that\\u2019s a no\\u2026 \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t behave myself in there, so I\\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore. \\u2018Cause strip clubs aren\\u2019t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like\\u2026 Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it\\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That\\u2019s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\\u2026 women wanna see a guy, \\u201cHey, ladies. He\\u2019s a fireman.\\u201d And he comes out with his hose and like that\\u2026 And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they\\u2019ve still got the fireman\\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\\u2019s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man\\u2019s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job\\u2019s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go\\u2026 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take care of your kids.\\u201d It\\u2019s\\u2026 And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it\\u2019s dry humping. There\\u2019s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go\\u2026 That\\u2019s what a private \\u201cdance\\u201d is, right? I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can\\u2019t imagine that there would be. I don\\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\\u2026 She goes, \\u201cHow was it?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell\\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.\\u201dSo Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would\\u2019ve thought it would\\u2019ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you\\u2019re watching the special. It was\\u2026 I\\u2019m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Now\\u2026 The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\\u2026 In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He\\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he\\u2019s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now\\u2026 the great thing about DJ is\\u2026 he already looks disabled. He has that \\u201clatter stages of AIDS\\u201d thing going on. It\\u2019s great for casting. Anyway, but\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors\\u2019 Union of America said, \\u201cYou cannot do that.\\u201d Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, \\u201cAll right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?\\u201d And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, \\u201cCan you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?\\u201d So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I\\u2019ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don\\u2019t know why. Maybe they\\u2019re just lazy. They don\\u2019t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good \\u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and\\u2026 they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I\\u2019d ever seen in my life. He was like\\u2026 Think of the most disabled person you\\u2019ve seen, then double it. \\u2026really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of\\u2026 [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway\\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\\u2026 and I\\u2019m sitting there, and we\\u2019re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn\\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, \\u201cThank you so much for coming in.\\u201d And then we did the dialog together, and I didn\\u2019t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our guy. That\\u2019s who we gotta pick.\\u201d And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he\\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\\u2019s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn\\u2019t really suit me because\\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought\\u2026 \\u201cIf he\\u2019s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.\\u201d So he comes in\\u2026 He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, \\u201cWhoa! What\\u2019s going on there, kicky?\\u201d And he goes\\u2026 \\u201cOh, you got me! I\\u2019m not disabled.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re fucking what now?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cJust shut up. So let me\\u2026 This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.\\u201d And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I\\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I\\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\\u2019ve got parts, and I\\u2019m holding this disabled guy\\u2019s headshot, and I just think, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna call this guy up. I\\u2019m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?\\u201d And I\\u2019m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like\\u2026 And I thought, \\u201cThis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.\\u201d The shutter on his camera has gotta be like\\u2026 [Mimicking camera shutter] Like\\u2026 [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy\\u2019s biography\\u2026 and then it dawned on me. \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!\\u201d Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I\\u2019m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, \\u201cTa-da!\\u201d And we would have gone, \\u201cThat was very good.\\u201d But I\\u2019ll tell you what you don\\u2019t do. Don\\u2019t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, \\u201cYou did very good.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThank you, Jim.\\u201d [Laughing][Chuckles] I was, uh\\u2026 I go to a therapist\\u2026 \\u2019cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.\\u201d Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, \\u201cRed,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cBlue.\\u201d And then she went, \\u201cCooking,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cFood,\\u201d and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went\\u2026 For the last question, she went, \\u201cAnd what\\u2019s your favorite thing in the world?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d Now\\u2026 Now, I could\\u2019ve said things like\\u2026 \\u201cIce cream\\u201d is a good answer. \\u201cHank\\u201d would\\u2019ve been an excellent answer. But I said, \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d And I\\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. \\u2013 I\\u2026 \\u2013 [Cheering] I\\u2019m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It\\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl\\u2019s on her knees and you\\u2026 It\\u2019s so\\u2026 And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, \\u201cWhen a caveman loves a cavewoman, he\\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\\u2019t come near.\\u201d There was never that\\u2026 never that moment. But, by golly, if it\\u2019s not fun. I find it\\u2026 To\\u2026 Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, \\u201cBravo!\\u201d Don\\u2019t\\u2026 don\\u2019t think what you do\\u2026 has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, \\u201cAnd here\\u2019s the women who take a load on their face.\\u201d And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, \\u201cGod bless you, ladies.\\u201d [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the\\u2026 Like that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know why, but I enjoy\\u2026 I know it\\u2019s a lie. I know you\\u2019re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it\\u2019s such a, \\u201cOh, jeez, I\\u2019m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there\\u2019s a good chance I\\u2019ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.\\u201d But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou fucking slut\\u2026 Oh, I love you. Ah\\u2026 Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um\\u2026 Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh\\u2026 All right, I\\u2019m going to get a towel. I\\u2019ll get a towel. I\\u2019ll get you a towel. All right. You\\u2019re a wonderful mother to our child.\\u201d [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See\\u2026 this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I\\u2019m the guy who\\u2019s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I\\u2019m there wiping come off his mother\\u2019s face.I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I\\u2019m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, \\u201cArgh!\\u201d Like that. And I went\\u2026 [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, \\u201cHello, Hankie.\\u201d And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him\\u2026 and a little suit\\u2026 and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, \\u201cI love my daddy. Love, Hank.\\u201d But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the \\u201cK,\\u201d and\\u2026 then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, \\u201cG\\u2019day, Hankie!\\u201d And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don\\u2019t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I\\u2019ve been telling everyone. And I can\\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life, he\\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He\\u2019s been training for this his entire life.I think I\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026 I think I\\u2019ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, \\u201cOh, I think like an American person now.\\u201d And I\\u2019m happy to do it. I just\\u2026 I\\u2019ll tell you what happened. I was flying around\\u2026 I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I\\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in America that\\u2026 Okay, what happens is, when you go\\u2026 I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there\\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don\\u2019t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady\\u2019s going, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I\\u2019m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. \\u2018Cause I get through airports quick, man. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFucking there you go.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPut your ID away. I don\\u2019t need to see that.\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cI think you do.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t\\u2026 Why would I need to see your ID?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI might be a terrorist.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWould showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?\\u201d \\u201cNo, I\\u2019d probably still blow the plane up.\\u201d So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I\\u2019m so good at the airports. I\\u2019m already taking my shoes off as I\\u2019m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I\\u2019m American, and they\\u2019re losing their fucking shit. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, for fuck\\u2019s sake! One of these cunts, eh?\\u201d And the TSA guy goes, \\u201cHey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 [Shouting] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know! Maybe they\\u2019re bombs?\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cBut they\\u2019re not, are they?\\u201d I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone\\u2019s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, \\u201cJeez, mate. That\\u2019s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?\\u201d \\u201cIt might also be a bomb.\\u201d And then the guy said the most Australian thing I\\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\\u2019s mouth ever. He went\\u2026 \\u201cOh, come on, mate. You wouldn\\u2019t have two bombs.\\u201d [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I\\u2019m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense.All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven\\u2019t been following the case, you\\u2019re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You\\u2019re fucking missing out, mate. If you don\\u2019t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He\\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine\\u2019s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth\\u2026 and that\\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\\u2026 \\u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can\\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there\\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone\\u2026 He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine\\u2019s Day, right? Now, I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running\\u2019s their second sport. You wouldn\\u2019t have thought that. Anyway\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can\\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here\\u2019s the difference. Picture my accent, but I\\u2019m punching a black person. What I\\u2019m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So\\u2026 she\\u2019s coming out of the shower. She\\u2019s been drying her hair. She\\u2019s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He\\u2019s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he\\u2019s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\\u2019ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?\\u201d \\u201cWho am I? I\\u2019m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That\\u2019s who the fuck I am.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.\\u201d \\u2013 [Audience exclaiming] \\u2013 I know. [Audience laughing] \\u201cOh! Fuck you!\\u201d \\u201cNo! Fuck you! I\\u2019m leaving you!\\u201d And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like\\u2026 \\u201cYou fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day\\u2026 that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don\\u2019t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!\\u201d That\\u2019s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.\\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn\\u2019t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar\\u2019s one of the few men on Earth that couldn\\u2019t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so\\u2026 Boing! Ah! So\\u2026 I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now\\u2026 in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put \\u201ca man\\u201d in that sentence, but whatever. I\\u2019ve never raped a man, but\\u2026 if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian\\u2026 \\u2019cause in prison, it\\u2019s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you\\u2019re tough and all that. Like, \\u201cYou want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?\\u201d There\\u2019d be a wonderful moment\\u2026 when you\\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He\\u2019s the hero.All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, \\u2013 I thank you very much for coming. \\u2013 [Audience groaning] No, I said, \\u201csoon,\\u201d not \\u201cover.\\u201d It\\u2019s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always\\u2026 I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I\\u2019m going to go, \\u201cFucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.\\u201d [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll be invited this time. They\\u2019ll be like, [In South African accent] \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like him. He\\u2019s no good.\\u201d Anyway, so, I\\u2019m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You\\u2019ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um\\u2026 But it was all right \\u2019cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn\\u2019t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice \\u2019cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I\\u2019ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit\\u2026 \\u2019cause it\\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\\u2019t want me there and they\\u2019re annoyed by my presence. So\\u2026 I\\u2019m wearing a white T-shirt that\\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I\\u2019m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, \\u201cHello,\\u201d and the lady goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cOh, Mr. Jefferies, I\\u2019m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou what now?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cBusiness class is full. You have been downgraded.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir. There\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d And then I just went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d Now, you know when you\\u2019re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, \\u2019cause as soon as you swear, they don\\u2019t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they\\u2019re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPlease do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cAre you, a white South African, telling me you\\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\\u201d Anyway\\u2026 tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat is wrong here? What is wrong?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can\\u2019t do anything.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d So I walk off with my ticket. I\\u2019m walking through the airport like, \\u201cFucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.\\u201d Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says \\u2018economy\\u2019 on it.\\u201d And I said\\u2026 [Inhales sharply] \\u201cI bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded\\u2026\\u201d And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, \\u201cNext.\\u201d [Audience exclaiming] \\u201cListen here, you fucking cunt.\\u201d [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say \\u201ccunt\\u201d in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you fucking come near me, cunt!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI want to speak to Simon Fulcher,\\u201d like I\\u2019m\\u2026 And they go, \\u201cAll right.\\u201d They ring the manager up, and then they go\\u2026 He goes, \\u201cIs it the pale Australian man?\\u201d And the guy went, \\u201cYes.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had problems with him. Let him through.\\u201d Right? So I go through. I\\u2019m sitting there, I\\u2019m eating my peanuts. And I\\u2019m just angry now, going, \\u201cFucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all\\u2026 And whenever I see Americans abroad\\u2026 I\\u2019ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you\\u2019re just pointing out shit you see. You\\u2019re just walking around going, [In American accent] \\u201cOh, this is great! Look at that. That\\u2019s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what\\u2019s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.\\u201d Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] \\u201cDid anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.\\u201d And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, \\u201cYou can fuck off and all! You don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve been through! I\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, \\u201cFucking downgraded!\\u201d And the woman in the group was doing this, \\u201cDon\\u2019t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?\\u201d And all the men in the group were like, \\u201cHey, why don\\u2019t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.\\u201d \\u266a It doesn\\u2019t matter These people seem very angry, so \\u266a And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] \\u201cHey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.\\u201d And then I thought, at least this guy\\u2019s being nice, and I said, \\u201cLook, mate, don\\u2019t worry about it. It\\u2019s not like it\\u2019s your fault.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy are you in such a big group anyway?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re in Neil Diamond\\u2019s band. That\\u2019s Neil Diamond\\u2019s backup singer you just called a cunt there.\\u201d And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero\\u2026 and I reacted like he was one. I went, \\u201cNeil Diamond!\\u201d And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] \\u201cHey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, \\u201cNeil! Me and all these people, we\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And Neil went, \\u201cOh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that\\u2019s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.\\u201d \\u201cYou can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!\\u201d And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don\\u2019t know if you have the Internet, but I\\u2019m not much of a fighter. I\\u2019m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. \\u201cHey, what have you got there? Hiya!\\u201d Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded\\u2026 but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let\\u2019s have a drink.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!I have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.The last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201dI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201dMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201dI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.You know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201dMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\u266a A whole new world \\u266aIt was magical.A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201dI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201dI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201dI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant?All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.More:Ali Wong, Stand-up transcripts SHARE THIS ARTICLE           Leave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
